###Parser Component
![ParserClassDiagram](img/ParserClassDiagram.png)
How the `Parser` component works:

The parse method in `Parser` is called from `InvMgr`, and takes in the raw user input as a String.
The method then checks through a logic gate whether the user input is valid, and returns 
a `Command` class based on the user input.
